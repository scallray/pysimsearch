Sample usage:

**Server**
::

    bash$ pysimsearch/sim_server.py sim_index -p 9001
    Use Control-C to exit


** pysimsearch Client **

>>> from pprint import pprint
>>> from pysimsearch import sim_index
>>> index = sim_index.RemoteSimIndex('http://localhost:9001/RPC2')
>>> index.index_filenames('http://www.stanford.edu/', 'http://www.berkeley.edu', 'http://www.ucla.edu')
>>> pprint(index.query_by_string('university'))
